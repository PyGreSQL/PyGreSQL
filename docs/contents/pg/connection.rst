Connection -- The connection object
===================================

.. currentmodule:: pg

.. class:: Connection

This object handles a connection to a PostgreSQL database. It embeds and
hides all the parameters that define this connection, thus just leaving really
significant parameters in function calls.

.. note::

    Some methods give direct access to the connection socket.
    *Do not use them unless you really know what you are doing.*
    If you prefer disabling them,
    do not set the ``direct_access`` option in the Python setup file.
    These methods are specified by the tag [DA].

.. note::

    Some other methods give access to large objects
    (refer to PostgreSQL user manual for more information about these).
    If you want to forbid access to these from the module,
    set the ``large_objects`` option in the Python setup file.
    These methods are specified by the tag [LO].

query -- execute a SQL command string
-------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.query(command, [args])

    Execute a SQL command string

    :param str command: SQL command
    :param args: optional parameter values
    :returns: result values
    :rtype: :class:`Query`, None
    :raises TypeError: bad argument type, or too many arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises ValueError: empty SQL query or lost connection
    :raises pg.ProgrammingError: error in query
    :raises pg.InternalError: error during query processing

This method simply sends a SQL query to the database. If the query is an
insert statement that inserted exactly one row into a table that has OIDs,
the return value is the OID of the newly inserted row as an integer.
If the query is an update or delete statement, or an insert statement that
did not insert exactly one row, or on a table without OIDs, then the number
of rows affected is returned as a string. If it is a statement that returns
rows as a result (usually a select statement, but maybe also an
``"insert/update ... returning"`` statement), this method returns
a :class:`Query`. Otherwise, it returns ``None``.

You can use the :class:`Query` object as an iterator that yields all results
as tuples, or call :meth:`Query.getresult` to get the result as a list
of tuples. Alternatively, you can call :meth:`Query.dictresult` or
:meth:`Query.dictiter` if you want to get the rows as dictionaries,
or :meth:`Query.namedresult` or :meth:`Query.namediter` if you want to
get the rows as named tuples. You can also simply print the :class:`Query`
object to show the query results on the console.

The SQL command may optionally contain positional parameters of the form
``$1``, ``$2``, etc instead of literal data, in which case the values
must be supplied separately as a tuple.  The values are substituted by
the database in such a way that they don't need to be escaped, making this
an effective way to pass arbitrary or unknown data without worrying about
SQL injection or syntax errors.

If you don't pass any parameters, the command string can also include
multiple SQL commands (separated by semicolons). You will only get the
return value for the last command in this case.

When the database could not process the query, a :exc:`pg.ProgrammingError` or
a :exc:`pg.InternalError` is raised. You can check the ``SQLSTATE`` error code
of this error by reading its :attr:`sqlstate` attribute.

Example::

    name = input("Name? ")
    phone = con.query("select phone from employees where name=$1",
        (name,)).getresult()


send_query - executes a SQL command string asynchronously
---------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.send_query(command, [args])

    Submits a command to the server without waiting for the result(s).

    :param str command: SQL command
    :param args: optional parameter values
    :returns: a query object, as described below
    :rtype: :class:`Query`
    :raises TypeError: bad argument type, or too many arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises ValueError: empty SQL query or lost connection
    :raises pg.ProgrammingError: error in query

This method is much the same as :meth:`Connection.query`, except that it
returns without waiting for the query to complete. The database connection
cannot be used for other operations until the query completes, but the
application can do other things, including executing queries using other
database connections. The application can call ``select()`` using the
``fileno``  obtained by the connection's :meth:`Connection.fileno` method
to determine when the query has results to return.

This method always returns a :class:`Query` object. This object differs
from the :class:`Query` object returned by :meth:`Connection.query` in a
few ways. Most importantly, when :meth:`Connection.send_query` is used, the
application must call one of the result-returning methods such as
:meth:`Query.getresult` or :meth:`Query.dictresult` until it either raises
an exception or returns ``None``.

Otherwise, the database connection will be left in an unusable state.

In cases when :meth:`Connection.query` would return something other than
a :class:`Query` object, that result will be returned by calling one of
the result-returning methods on the :class:`Query` object returned by
:meth:`Connection.send_query`. There's one important difference in these
result codes: if :meth:`Connection.query` returns `None`, the result-returning
methods will return an empty string (`''`). It's still necessary to call a
result-returning method until it returns `None`.

:meth:`Query.listfields`, :meth:`Query.fieldname`, :meth:`Query.fieldnum`,
and :meth:`Query.ntuples` only work after a call to a result-returning method
with a non-`None` return value. :meth:`Query.ntuples` returns only the number
of rows returned by the previous result-returning method.

If multiple semi-colon-delimited statements are passed to
:meth:`Connection.query`, only the results of the last statement are returned
in the :class:`Query` object. With :meth:`Connection.send_query`, all results
are returned. Each result set will be returned by a separate call to
:meth:`Query.getresult()` or other result-returning methods.

.. versionadded:: 5.2

Examples::

    name = input("Name? ")
    query = con.send_query("select phone from employees where name=$1",
                          (name,))
    phone = query.getresult()
    query.getresult()  # to close the query

    # Run two queries in one round trip:
    # (Note that you cannot use a union here
    # when the result sets have different row types.)
    query = con.send_query("select a,b,c from x where d=e;
                          "select e,f from y where g")
    result_x = query.dictresult()
    result_y = query.dictresult()
    query.dictresult()  # to close the query

    # Using select() to wait for the query to be ready:
    query = con.send_query("select pg_sleep(20)")
    r, w, e = select([con.fileno(), other, sockets], [], [])
    if con.fileno() in r:
        results = query.getresult()
        query.getresult()  # to close the query

    # Concurrent queries on separate connections:
    con1 = connect()
    con2 = connect()
    s = con1.query("begin; set transaction isolation level repeatable read;"
                   "select pg_export_snapshot();").single()
    con2.query("begin; set transaction isolation level repeatable read;"
               "set transaction snapshot '%s'" % (s,))
    q1 = con1.send_query("select a,b,c from x where d=e")
    q2 = con2.send_query("select e,f from y where g")
    r1 = q1.getresult()
    q1.getresult()
    r2 = q2.getresult()
    q2.getresult()
    con1.query("commit")
    con2.query("commit")


query_prepared -- execute a prepared statement
----------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.query_prepared(name, [args])

    Execute a prepared statement

    :param str name: name of the prepared statement
    :param args: optional parameter values
    :returns: result values
    :rtype: :class:`Query`, None
    :raises TypeError: bad argument type, or too many arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises ValueError: empty SQL query or lost connection
    :raises pg.ProgrammingError: error in query
    :raises pg.InternalError: error during query processing
    :raises pg.OperationalError: prepared statement does not exist

This method works exactly like :meth:`Connection.query` except that instead
of passing the command itself, you pass the name of a prepared statement.
An empty name corresponds to the unnamed statement.  You must have previously
created the corresponding named or unnamed statement with
:meth:`Connection.prepare`, or an :exc:`pg.OperationalError` will be raised.

.. versionadded:: 5.1

prepare -- create a prepared statement
--------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.prepare(name, command)

    Create a prepared statement

    :param str name: name of the prepared statement
    :param str command: SQL command
    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: bad argument types, or wrong number of arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises pg.ProgrammingError: error in query or duplicate query

This method creates a prepared statement with the specified name for the
given command for later execution with the :meth:`Connection.query_prepared`
method. The name can be empty to create an unnamed statement, in which case
any pre-existing unnamed statement is automatically replaced; otherwise a
:exc:`pg.ProgrammingError` is raised if the statement name is already defined
in the current database session.

The SQL command may optionally contain positional parameters of the form
``$1``, ``$2``, etc instead of literal data.  The corresponding values
must then later be passed to the :meth:`Connection.query_prepared` method
separately as a tuple.

.. versionadded:: 5.1

describe_prepared -- describe a prepared statement
--------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.describe_prepared(name)

    Describe a prepared statement

    :param str name: name of the prepared statement
    :rtype: :class:`Query`
    :raises TypeError: bad argument type, or too many arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises pg.OperationalError: prepared statement does not exist

This method returns a :class:`Query` object describing the prepared
statement with the given name.  You can also pass an empty name in order
to describe the unnamed statement.  Information on the fields of the
corresponding query can be obtained through the :meth:`Query.listfields`,
:meth:`Query.fieldname` and :meth:`Query.fieldnum` methods.

.. versionadded:: 5.1

reset -- reset the connection
-----------------------------

.. method:: Connection.reset()

    Reset the :mod:`pg` connection

    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

This method resets the current database connection.

poll - completes an asynchronous connection
-------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.poll()

    Complete an asynchronous :mod:`pg` connection and get its state

    :returns: state of the connection
    :rtype: int
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises pg.InternalError: some error occurred during pg connection

The database connection can be performed without any blocking calls.
This allows the application mainline to perform other operations or perhaps
connect to multiple databases concurrently. Once the connection is established,
it's no different from a connection made using blocking calls.

The required steps are to pass the parameter ``nowait=True`` to  the
:meth:`pg.connect` call, then call :meth:`Connection.poll` until it either
returns :const:`POLLING_OK` or raises an exception. To avoid blocking
in :meth:`Connection.poll`, use `select()` or `poll()` to wait for the
connection to be readable or writable, depending on the return code of the
previous call to :meth:`Connection.poll`. The initial state of the connection
is :const:`POLLING_WRITING`. The possible states are defined as constants in
the :mod:`pg` module (:const:`POLLING_OK`, :const:`POLLING_FAILED`,
:const:`POLLING_READING` and :const:`POLLING_WRITING`).

.. versionadded:: 5.2

Example::

    con = pg.connect('testdb', nowait=True)
    fileno = con.fileno()
    rd = []
    wt = [fileno]
    rc = pg.POLLING_WRITING
    while rc not in (pg.POLLING_OK, pg.POLLING_FAILED):
        ra, wa, xa = select(rd, wt, [], timeout)
        if not ra and not wa:
            timedout()
        rc = con.poll()
        if rc == pg.POLLING_READING:
            rd = [fileno]
            wt = []
        else:
            rd = []
            wt = [fileno]


cancel -- abandon processing of current SQL command
---------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.cancel()

    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

This method requests that the server abandon processing
of the current SQL command.

close -- close the database connection
--------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.close()

    Close the :mod:`pg` connection

    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments

This method closes the database connection. The connection will
be closed in any case when the connection is deleted but this
allows you to explicitly close it. It is mainly here to allow
the DB-SIG API wrapper to implement a close function.

transaction -- get the current transaction state
------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.transaction()

    Get the current in-transaction status of the server

    :returns: the current in-transaction status
    :rtype: int
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

The status returned by this method can be :const:`TRANS_IDLE` (currently idle),
:const:`TRANS_ACTIVE` (a command is in progress), :const:`TRANS_INTRANS` (idle,
in a valid transaction block), or :const:`TRANS_INERROR` (idle, in a failed
transaction block).  :const:`TRANS_UNKNOWN` is reported if the connection is
bad.  The status :const:`TRANS_ACTIVE` is reported only when a query has been
sent to the server and not yet completed.

parameter -- get a current server parameter setting
---------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.parameter(name)

    Look up a current parameter setting of the server

    :param str name: the name of the parameter to look up
    :returns: the current setting of the specified parameter
    :rtype: str or None
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

Certain parameter values are reported by the server automatically at
connection startup or whenever their values change.  This method can be used
to interrogate these settings.  It returns the current value of a parameter
if known, or *None* if the parameter is not known.

You can use this method to check the settings of important parameters such as
`server_version`, `server_encoding`, `client_encoding`, `application_name`,
`is_superuser`, `session_authorization`, `DateStyle`, `IntervalStyle`,
`TimeZone`, `integer_datetimes`, and `standard_conforming_strings`.

Values that are not reported by this method can be requested using
:meth:`DB.get_parameter`.

.. versionadded:: 4.0

date_format -- get the currently used date format
-------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.date_format()

    Look up the date format currently being used by the database

    :returns: the current date format
    :rtype: str
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

This method returns the current date format used by the server.  Note that
it is cheap to call this method, since there is no database query involved
and the setting is also cached internally.  You will need the date format
when you want to manually typecast dates and timestamps coming from the
database instead of using the built-in typecast functions.  The date format
returned by this method can be directly used with date formatting functions
such as :meth:`datetime.strptime`.  It is derived from the current setting
of the database parameter ``DateStyle``.

.. versionadded:: 5.0

fileno -- get the socket used to connect to the database
--------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.fileno()

    Get the socket used to connect to the database

    :returns: the socket id of the database connection
    :rtype: int
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

This method returns the underlying socket id used to connect
to the database. This is useful for use in select calls, etc.

set_non_blocking - set the non-blocking status of the connection
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: set_non_blocking(nb)

    Set the non-blocking mode of the connection

    :param bool nb: True to put the connection into non-blocking mode.
                    False to put it into blocking mode.
    :raises TypeError: too many parameters
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

Puts the socket connection into non-blocking mode or into blocking mode.
This affects copy commands and large object operations, but not queries.

.. versionadded:: 5.2

is_non_blocking - report the blocking status of the connection
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: is_non_blocking()

    get the non-blocking mode of the connection

    :returns: True if the connection is in non-blocking mode.
              False if it is in blocking mode.
    :rtype: bool
    :raises TypeError: too many parameters
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

Returns True if the connection is in non-blocking mode, False otherwise.

.. versionadded:: 5.2

getnotify -- get the last notify from the server
------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.getnotify()

    Get the last notify from the server

    :returns: last notify from server
    :rtype: tuple, None
    :raises TypeError: too many parameters
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection

This method tries to get a notify from the server (from the SQL statement
NOTIFY). If the server returns no notify, the methods returns None.
Otherwise, it returns a tuple (triplet) *(relname, pid, extra)*, where
*relname* is the name of the notify, *pid* is the process id of the
connection that triggered the notify, and *extra* is a payload string
that has been sent with the notification. Remember to do a listen query
first, otherwise :meth:`Connection.getnotify` will always return ``None``.

.. versionchanged:: 4.1
    Support for payload strings was added in version 4.1.

inserttable -- insert a list into a table
-----------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.inserttable(table, values, [columns])

    Insert a Python list into a database table

    :param str table: the table name
    :param list values: list of rows values
    :param list columns: list of column names
    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection, bad argument type, or too many arguments
    :raises MemoryError: insert buffer could not be allocated
    :raises ValueError: unsupported values

This method allows to *quickly* insert large blocks of data in a table:
It inserts the whole values list into the given table. Internally, it
uses the COPY command of the PostgreSQL database. The list is a list
of tuples/lists that define the values for each inserted row. The rows
values may contain string, integer, long or double (real) values.
``columns`` is an optional sequence of column names to be passed on
to the COPY command.

.. warning::

    This method doesn't type check the fields according to the table definition;
    it just looks whether or not it knows how to handle such types.

get/set_cast_hook -- fallback typecast function
-----------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.get_cast_hook()

    Get the function that handles all external typecasting

    :returns: the current external typecast function
    :rtype: callable, None
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments

This returns the callback function used by PyGreSQL to provide plug-in
Python typecast functions for the connection.

.. versionadded:: 5.0

.. method:: Connection.set_cast_hook(func)

    Set a function that will handle all external typecasting

    :param func: the function to be used as a callback
    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: the specified notice receiver is not callable

This methods allows setting a custom fallback function for providing
Python typecast functions for the connection to supplement the C
extension module.  If you set this function to *None*, then only the typecast
functions implemented in the C extension module are enabled.  You normally
would not want to change this.  Instead, you can use :func:`get_typecast` and
:func:`set_typecast` to add or change the plug-in Python typecast functions.

.. versionadded:: 5.0

get/set_notice_receiver -- custom notice receiver
-------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.get_notice_receiver()

    Get the current notice receiver

    :returns: the current notice receiver callable
    :rtype: callable, None
    :raises TypeError: too many (any) arguments

This method gets the custom notice receiver callback function that has
been set with :meth:`Connection.set_notice_receiver`, or ``None`` if no
custom notice receiver has ever been set on the connection.

.. versionadded:: 4.1

.. method:: Connection.set_notice_receiver(func)

    Set a custom notice receiver

    :param func: the custom notice receiver callback function
    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: the specified notice receiver is not callable

This method allows setting a custom notice receiver callback function.
When a notice or warning message is received from the server,
or generated internally by libpq, and the message level is below
the one set with ``client_min_messages``, the specified notice receiver
function will be called. This function must take one parameter,
the :class:`Notice` object, which provides the following read-only
attributes:

    .. attribute:: Notice.pgcnx

        the connection

    .. attribute:: Notice.message

        the full message with a trailing newline

    .. attribute:: Notice.severity

        the level of the message, e.g. 'NOTICE' or 'WARNING'

    .. attribute:: Notice.primary

        the primary human-readable error message

    .. attribute:: Notice.detail

        an optional secondary error message

    .. attribute:: Notice.hint

        an optional suggestion what to do about the problem

.. versionadded:: 4.1

putline -- write a line to the server socket [DA]
-------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.putline(line)

    Write a line to the server socket

    :param str line: line to be written
    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection, bad parameter type, or too many parameters

This method allows to directly write a string to the server socket.

getline -- get a line from server socket [DA]
---------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.getline()

    Get a line from server socket

    :returns:  the line read
    :rtype: str
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises TypeError: too many parameters
    :raises MemoryError: buffer overflow

This method allows to directly read a string from the server socket.

endcopy -- synchronize client and server [DA]
---------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.endcopy()

    Synchronize client and server

    :rtype: None
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection
    :raises TypeError: too many parameters

The use of direct access methods may desynchronize client and server.
This method ensure that client and server will be synchronized.

locreate -- create a large object in the database [LO]
------------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.locreate(mode)

    Create a large object in the database

    :param int mode: large object create mode
    :returns: object handling the PostgreSQL large object
    :rtype: :class:`LargeObject`
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection, bad parameter type, or too many parameters
    :raises pg.OperationalError: creation error

This method creates a large object in the database. The mode can be defined
by OR-ing the constants defined in the :mod:`pg` module (:const:`INV_READ`,
and :const:`INV_WRITE`). Please refer to PostgreSQL user manual for a
description of the mode values.

getlo -- build a large object from given oid [LO]
-------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.getlo(oid)

    Create a large object in the database

    :param int oid: OID of the existing large object
    :returns: object handling the PostgreSQL large object
    :rtype: :class:`LargeObject`
    :raises TypeError:  invalid connection, bad parameter type, or too many parameters
    :raises ValueError: bad OID value (0 is invalid_oid)

This method allows reusing a previously created large object through the
:class:`LargeObject` interface, provided the user has its OID.

loimport -- import a file to a large object [LO]
------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Connection.loimport(name)

    Import a file to a large object

    :param str name: the name of the file to be imported
    :returns: object handling the PostgreSQL large object
    :rtype: :class:`LargeObject`
    :raises TypeError: invalid connection, bad argument type, or too many arguments
    :raises pg.OperationalError: error during file import

This methods allows to create large objects in a very simple way. You just
give the name of a file containing the data to be used.
